# Logging Core Module version 1.6.0

SIGHUP team maintains this module updated and tested. That is the main reason why we worked on this new release.
With the Kubernetes 1.19 release, it became the perfect time to start testing this module against this Kubernetes
release. During the latest release, 1.5.0, the team prepared the module to be easily updatable to the next major
ElasticSearch version: from 6 to 7. Other minor works have been done in this module updating Cerebro and the log
collector releases.
