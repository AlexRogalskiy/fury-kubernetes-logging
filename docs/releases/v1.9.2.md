# Logging Core Module version 1.9.2

`fury-kubernetes-logging` is part of the SIGHUP maintained [Kubernetes Fury Distribution](https://github.com/sighupio/fury-distribution). The module ships a logging stack to be deployed on the Kubernetes cluster based on ElasticSearch. Team SIGHUP makes it a priority to maintain these modules in compliance with CNCF and with all the latest features from upstream.

This is a patch release that adds a Makefile to the logging module, along with a `Contributing.md` which describes dev workflow for the module management. This release also updates the bumpversion configuration file.
